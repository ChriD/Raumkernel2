# Raumkernel

A C/C++ Library which can be used to control the Raumfeld Multiroom System

This library replaces the old "Raumkernel v1" library.
Be aware that it is not compatible with the version 1 library.

It's a redesigned kernel without the use of boost libraries (instead using C++11)
There will be makefiles for Windows x86 / Linux x86 / linux ARMV6 / linux ARMV7
