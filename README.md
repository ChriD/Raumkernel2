# Raumkernel v2
This library will replace the old "Raumkernel v1" library.
Be aware that it is not compatible with the version 1 library.

It's a redesigned kernel without the use of boost libraries (instead using C++11)
There will be makefiles for Windows x86 / Linux x86 / linux ARMV6 / linux ARMV7
